# ðŸš¨ Anomaly Detection System

## Detection Methods
The system employs multiple statistical and rule-based methods to identify anomalies across supply chain operations. Statistical methods use moving averages and standard deviation calculations to detect deviations from normal patterns. Rule-based methods apply business rules like safety stock violations and delivery deadline breaches. Machine learning approaches use historical patterns to predict expected ranges and flag outliers.

## Inventory Anomalies
Stockout Risk Detection: Monitors current stock levels against safety stock thresholds, calculating the gap and time-to-stockout based on consumption rates. Identifies products that have crossed or are approaching safety stock levels with severity based on how far below threshold and rate of depletion.

Overstock Detection: Identifies excess inventory situations where stock levels significantly exceed target levels, calculating the financial impact of tied-up capital and storage costs. Considers product category and seasonality factors to determine appropriate stock levels.

Consumption Pattern Anomalies: Analyzes historical consumption data to identify unusual spikes or drops in demand that deviate from established patterns. Uses moving averages and seasonal adjustments to account for normal variations while flagging statistically significant deviations.

## Supplier Anomalies
Risk Score Monitoring: Tracks supplier risk scores calculated from multiple factors including delivery performance, financial stability, and geographic risk. Flags suppliers with deteriorating scores or those crossing high-risk thresholds for proactive management.

Performance Degradation: Monitors key performance indicators like on-time delivery rates and quality metrics for negative trends. Identifies suppliers showing consistent decline in performance across multiple metrics over time.

Concentration Risk: Analyzes supplier base for over-reliance on single sources or geographic concentrations. Flags situations where critical components depend on limited suppliers or regions with elevated risk profiles.

## Shipping Anomalies
Delivery Delay Detection: Monitors shipment status against estimated delivery dates, identifying delays and calculating the extent of lateness. Correlates delays with carriers, routes, and product types to identify systemic issues.

Carrier Performance Issues: Tracks carrier reliability metrics including on-time performance, damage rates, and cost efficiency. Flags carriers showing consistent underperformance or sudden degradation in service quality.

Route Optimization Alerts: Analyzes shipping routes for inefficiencies and unexpected deviations. Identifies opportunities for route optimization and flags situations where actual routes differ significantly from planned ones.

## Market & External Anomalies
Geopolitical Risk Monitoring: Tracks external factors like political instability, trade restrictions, and regulatory changes that could impact supply chain operations. Correlates these factors with supplier locations and product categories.

Weather and Natural Disaster Impact: Monitors weather patterns and natural disaster alerts that could disrupt logistics and production. Provides early warning for potential disruptions based on historical impact patterns.

Commodity Price Volatility: Tracks raw material and component pricing for unusual fluctuations that could impact product costs and availability. Identifies pricing trends that may require procurement strategy adjustments.

## Alert Classification
Severity Levels: Critical alerts require immediate action to prevent significant business impact. High alerts indicate serious issues needing prompt attention. Medium alerts represent issues requiring monitoring and planned resolution. Low alerts are informational items for awareness.

Alert Triggers: Threshold-based triggers activate when metrics cross predefined levels. Trend-based triggers activate when negative patterns emerge over time. Pattern-based triggers use statistical analysis to identify deviations from normal behavior.

Response Protocols: Critical alerts trigger immediate escalation and response procedures. High alerts require resolution within defined timeframes with regular status updates. Medium and low alerts follow standard monitoring and resolution workflows with appropriate documentation.
