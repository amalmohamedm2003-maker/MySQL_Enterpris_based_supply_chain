# ðŸ”„ Data Flow & Processing Pipeline

## Data Ingestion Layer
External systems provide data through CSV imports or API integrations. Supplier data comes from vendor management systems, inventory data from warehouse management systems, shipment data from logistics providers, and market data from external sources. All incoming data undergoes validation checks including data type verification, constraint validation, and duplicate prevention before being stored in standardized format within partitioned MySQL tables.

## Core Data Processing Flow
The system processes data through five sequential stages. Data collection gathers information from suppliers, products, inventory, shipments, and market events. Data validation performs quality checks and constraint validation. Real-time processing executes stored procedures for anomaly detection, risk scoring, and alert generation. Batch processing handles daily snapshots, weekly aggregates, monthly reports, and archiving. Analytics and reporting deliver dashboards, executive reports, alert notifications, and API exports.

## Inventory Data Flow
Daily inventory updates from multiple warehouses feed into stock level analysis comparing current levels against safety stock thresholds. This analysis triggers anomaly detection using statistical methods to identify outliers and pattern recognition for trend analysis. Detected anomalies generate alerts with critical issues triggering immediate notifications via email or SMS while lower priority items appear on dashboards.

## Supplier Data Flow
Supplier master data including company information and capabilities combines with performance tracking of delivery times and quality metrics. This feeds into risk calculation considering financial stability and geographic factors, resulting in comprehensive supplier scoring. The scoring determines tier classification and influences procurement decisions and risk mitigation strategies.

## Shipping Data Flow
Shipment records with carrier information and delivery schedules undergo on-time performance analysis. Delay detection identifies late deliveries and estimates impact, while carrier performance tracking monitors reliability across different logistics providers. This data feeds into both operational alerts for immediate issues and strategic analysis for carrier selection and contract negotiations.

## Alert Processing Flow
Anomaly detection across all data sources identifies potential issues which are then evaluated for severity classification. Critical and high severity alerts trigger immediate notifications while all alerts are logged for tracking. The system supports alert resolution workflows with assignment, investigation, and closure processes, maintaining complete audit trails of all alert activities.
